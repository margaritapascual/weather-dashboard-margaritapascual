## ‚úçÔ∏è Section 1: Week 11 Reflection

### Key Takeaways

- This week helped me see the full scope of the capstone‚Äîwhat‚Äôs expected and how we‚Äôll build week by week.
- It reminded me that good planning and file structure upfront saves a lot of stress later.
- I feel more confident knowing I can mix features based on what I‚Äôm good at and what I want to get better at.
- The project gives me a chance to apply everything I‚Äôve learned so far in a way that‚Äôs creative and useful.
- I also understand that submitting progress every week is part of the growth process‚Äînot just about having it ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù

### Concept Connections

- I feel solid when it comes to writing functions, handling files, and working with basic APIs.
- I‚Äôm comfortable using `.txt`, `.csv`, and `.json` formats for storing data.
- I need more practice with Tkinter layouts and making things look clean and organized.
- Embedding a chart using matplotlib is still something I‚Äôm figuring out.
- I‚Äôm still wrapping my head around architecture patterns like MVC, but I‚Äôm trying to stay modular from the start.

### Early Challenges

- Making sure the API key is hidden correctly and not committed by accident.
- Deciding where each feature should live and making sure the folders make sense.
- Debugging early API requests and learning how to catch and display errors clearly.
- Figuring out what should go in `config.py` versus `main.py` was a small hurdle at first.

### Support Strategies

- I plan to go to office hours, especially to get feedback on my graphing and layout.
- I‚Äôll keep using Slack if I get stuck‚Äîespecially with plotting and file I/O.
- Looking at past GitHub capstones helps me see how others organized their projects.
- I‚Äôm watching short videos to understand how people structure interactive Python apps.

## üß† Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale

| #  | Feature Name                 | Difficulty (1‚Äì3) | Why You Chose It / Learning Goal                                   |
|----|------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Show Historical Weather Data | 2                | I want to practice storing past weather info and displaying it back to the user. |
| 2  | Plot Temperature Graph       | 3                | I want to push myself to use matplotlib inside a Tkinter window.    |
| 3  | Display Current Conditions & Icons | 2         | I like the idea of showing live data and pairing it with visuals.   |
| ‚Äì  | Theme Switcher (light/dark toggle)| ‚Äì          | I just think it adds a nice user touch and helps me explore styling in Tkinter. |

## üóÇÔ∏è Section 3: High-Level Architecture Sketch

My project follows a simple structure that makes it easy to build and test each feature:

**Flow:**

- User enters location ‚Üí data is validated
- Weather info is fetched using API
- Info is passed to Tkinter app to show the results
- Features like graphs, icons, and history are plugged into the GUI
- An error handler makes sure things don‚Äôt crash if something goes wrong

**Folders/Files:**

- `main.py` runs the app
- `config.py` holds keys and settings
- `/features/` includes:
  - `historical_data.py`
  - `temperature_graph.py`
  - `current_conditions_icons.py`
  - `theme_switcher.py`
- `/data/` saves weather history and other info

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Section 6: Risk Assessment

| Risk                    | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Plan                                      |
|-------------------------|------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| API Rate Limit          | Medium     | Medium | Add a delay between calls and save recent results locally. |
| Graph not rendering     | Medium     | High   | Test graph code outside the GUI first before adding it in. |
| Layout issues with Tkinter | Low     | Medium | Break GUI into frames and test one part at a time.     |

## ü§ù Section 7: Support Requests

- I‚Äôll need help embedding matplotlib graphs inside my app window.
- Might ask how to pass data across multiple feature files.
- I want feedback on the way I‚Äôm handling errors and validation.
- I may need a second pair of eyes on how I‚Äôm setting up the dark/light theme toggle.
